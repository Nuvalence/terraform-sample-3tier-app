####  TO-DO: Students observe ONLY. Instructor rolls out the stack.
  
##  DO NOT DEPLOY THE STACK IF YOU ARE A STUDENT IN THE WORKSHOP. 
  
1) Instructor deploys stack. This takes some time; move on to the next instruction. 
  
2) Review the example terraform resources and examine how the resources are grouped and referenced. 

3) Introduce the Meta-Arguments, Expressions, and Functions sections of the documentation to become familiar with their availability within the scope of the language
  > https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/module-providers.html
  > https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/expressions/index.html
  > https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/functions/index.html
